Two debates with different outcomes were picked, one in which the US vetoed, and one during which the US did not Veto a resolution. We took special attention on keeping all other possible confounding variables stable. The military situation on the ground did not change and there is nothing pointing to a shift in foreign policy.\nThe speeches of all the P5 member were coded using a Codebook inspired from International Law, the functioning of the Council and the dynamics during the two debates. Each sentence was coded and attributed to a type of rhetoric in line with the Codebook.\nThis data will should hopefully allow us to compare the impact of rhetoric on the US’s voting behavior at the UNSC."
